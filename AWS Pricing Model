AWS Pricing Model:
1. Free Tier
                The AWS Free Tier provides a low-risk opportunity to explore and experiment with AWS services at no cost. 
                It is ideal for beginners, developers, and startups looking to test AWS services or build small-scale applications.
                
                What Does the Free Tier Include?
                The Free Tier is divided into three types:
                
                        Always Free: Services that are free within defined limits indefinitely.
                        12-Month Free: Services available for free for the first 12 months after signing up.
                        Trial Offers: Limited-time trials for specific services.

                Examples of Free Tier Limits:

                        750 Hours of EC2 t2.micro or t3.micro Instances per month (Linux/Windows).
                Storage:
                        5 GB of Amazon S3 Standard Storage per month.

                                Prototyping and testing applications.
2. Pay-As-You-Go
          The Pay-As-You-Go model ensures customers only pay for the resources they actually use, avoiding upfront costs and minimizing wastage.
          
          How It Works:
                Per-Second/Per-Hour Billing:
                            For compute services like EC2, customers are billed based on the number of seconds or hours instances are active.
                Data Storage Billing:
                              Services like S3 charge based on the amount of data stored and data transferred out of the cloud.
                On-Demand Services:
                              Only use and pay for services when needed, such as spinning up a virtual machine during high traffic.
          Advantages:
                      No Upfront Costs: Start small and scale as you grow.
                      Transparent Billing: Easily track and manage costs with detailed usage reports.
                      Flexibility: Adjust resource usage dynamically based on workload requirements.
