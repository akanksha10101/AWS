Types of Cloud Environments:

1. Public Cloud
          A Public Cloud is a cloud environment operated by third-party providers, where computing resources such as servers, storage, and networking are shared among
          multiple users (multi-tenant). These resources are accessible over the internet, making them widely available and easy to scale.
          
          Advantages:
                      Cost-Effective: Users pay only for the resources they use, eliminating the need for upfront investments in infrastructure.
                      Scalable: Resources can be increased or decreased as needed with minimal effort, catering to variable workloads.
                      No Maintenance: The provider handles maintenance, updates, and hardware management, reducing operational burdens for users.
          Examples:
                  Amazon Web Services (AWS)
                  Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
                  Microsoft Azure
          Use Case:
                  Public clouds are ideal for startups and small to medium-sized businesses that have variable workloads, as they provide affordable and scalable solutions without requiring extensive technical expertise.

2. Private Cloud
          A Private Cloud is a cloud environment that is dedicated to a single organization. It can be hosted on the organization’s on-premises infrastructure
          or managed by a third-party provider. This model offers exclusive access to resources, giving organizations greater control over their data and systems.
          
          Advantages:
                    Enhanced Security: Provides robust security measures, making it suitable for industries with strict compliance requirements.
                    Customizable: Organizations can tailor the infrastructure to meet specific business needs and performance requirements.
                    Control: Greater control over the data, resources, and applications as they are not shared with others.
          Examples:
                    VMware Private Cloud
                    IBM Private Cloud
          Use Case:
                Private clouds are commonly used by industries like finance, healthcare, and government, where data privacy, security, and regulatory compliance are critical.

3. Hybrid Cloud:
          A Hybrid Cloud combines the features of both public and private cloud environments, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.
          This model offers businesses the flexibility to keep sensitive workloads on private clouds while utilizing public clouds for scalable, non-sensitive tasks.

Advantages:
          Flexibility: Enables organizations to move workloads seamlessly between private and public environments based on current requirements.
          Cost-Effectiveness: Balances the cost by utilizing the public cloud for scalable workloads while retaining sensitive data in the private cloud.
          Enhanced Performance: Optimizes resource utilization by dividing workloads between environments as needed.
Examples:
        AWS Outposts
        Microsoft Azure Stack
Use Case:
        Hybrid clouds are well-suited for businesses that require both scalability and data security, such as enterprises managing
         customer-facing applications on the public cloud while maintaining sensitive records in a private cloud.
