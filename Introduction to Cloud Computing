Introduction to Cloud Computing

      Cloud Computing is the delivery of various computing services over the internet,
      enabling businesses and individuals to access and utilize resources without the need for physical infrastructure. 
      These services are provided by cloud service providers and are billed on a pay-as-you-go basis, offering flexibility, scalability, and cost efficiency.


Key Features of Cloud Computing:
        On-Demand Self-Service: 
                              Users can provision resources automatically as needed, without requiring human interaction with the service provider.
        Broad Network Access: 
                              Resources are available over the internet and can be accessed from anywhere using devices like laptops, smartphones, or tablets.
        Resource Pooling: 
                              Multiple users share a pool of resources dynamically assigned and reassigned based on demand.
        Scalability and Elasticity: 
                              Resources can scale up or down automatically to meet workload demands.
        Measured Service: 
                              Usage is monitored, controlled, and billed based on actual consumption, ensuring cost-efficiency.
                              Popular providers include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Characteristics of Cloud Computing:
        On-Demand Self-Service:
                              Users can access resources as needed without human interaction from the provider.
        Pay-As-You-Go Pricing:
                                Customers only pay for the resources they use, reducing upfront capital expenditure.
        Scalability:
                      Automatic scaling of resources to meet fluctuating demands.
        Includes vertical scaling (adding more power to an existing machine) and horizontal scaling (adding more machines).
        Broad Network Access:
                    Resources are accessible over the internet, enabling use from multiple devices.
        Resource Pooling:
                        Providers use a multi-tenant model where resources are dynamically assigned based on demand.
        Rapid Elasticity:
                                Resources can be quickly scaled up or down, often appearing limitless to users.
        Measured Service:
                            Usage is monitored, controlled, and reported for transparency.
