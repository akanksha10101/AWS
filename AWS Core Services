Overview of AWS Core Services:
1. Compute Services:
                  AWS compute services allow businesses to run applications, manage workloads, and handle computing tasks on-demand.
                  
                  Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):
                              Amazon EC2 provides resizable virtual servers in the cloud, allowing businesses to deploy and scale applications easily. 
                              Users can choose from a variety of instance types tailored to specific use cases, such as general-purpose, compute-intensive,
                              or memory-intensive workloads.
                  Key Features:
                            Scalable: Resources can be scaled up or down based on demand.
                            Flexible Pricing: Offers On-Demand, Reserved, and Spot Instances.
                            High Availability: Supports deployment across multiple Availability Zones.
                  Use Cases:
                            Hosting websites and applications.
                            Running batch jobs or high-performance computing workloads.
                            Development and testing environments.
                  AWS Lambda:
                              AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. 
                              Code is executed in response to events such as file uploads, database changes, or API requests.
                  Key Features:
                          Fully Managed: No need to manage infrastructure; AWS handles scaling and availability.
                          Pay-Per-Use: You are billed only for the compute time your code uses.
                          Event-Driven: Triggered by AWS services like S3, DynamoDB, or custom APIs.
                  Use Cases:
                              Running microservices and serverless applications.
                              Processing real-time data streams.
                              Automating tasks such as image resizing or log processing.
2. Storage Services
                      AWS storage services provide secure, scalable, and cost-effective solutions for storing data of all types.
                      
                      Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
                              Amazon S3 is an object storage service designed for scalability, durability, and low-latency data access.
                              It’s ideal for storing files, backups, and archival data.
                      Key Features:
                              99.999999999% Durability: Ensures data is safe and recoverable.
                              Tiered Storage: Includes standard, infrequent access, and archival tiers like Glacier.
                                Integrated Security: Supports encryption and fine-grained access controls.
